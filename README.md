# Clinique-Plus is a web page that holds hospital informations for both patient, staffs and other records
The product is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
At the left and side of the page, when you click on the arrow on the LIS, it drops down additional options for LIS.
At the nav bar, if you click on the down arrow, it drops down additional options on functions that can be accessed.
On the right side container, where you have the HR/Staff profile, if you click on the profile, it drops down more options on the the staff informations. same process can be
replicated on the other dialogues. is a work in progress, so expect further improvement.
Will be open to any advice to improve on this project for better perfomance.
